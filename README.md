# Coinz

This little Android app is the result of a University project that spanned one semester. The main idea of the app was to have coins spawn "randomly" in a given area and then be collectable by the player by walking within a certain distance of the coin and clicking on it. An application showcase, including screenshots, can be found at the end of the [implementation report](https://github.com/smueksch/coinz/blob/master/report/ilp-report.pdf).
